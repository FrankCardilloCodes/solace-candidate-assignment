## General Notes

- I wasn't quite sure if I was supposed to leave my PRs open. Obviously in a real, collaborative environment I wouldn't just merge things without approval from the team. But I wanted to be able to iterate off of my previous work in subsequent PRs in a linear fashion, so I just merged stuff when I felt ready to move onto the next task. Hopefully looking at the merged PRs tab in github still tells a coherent enough story for you to assess me
